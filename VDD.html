          <h2>Voice pathology Detection</h2>
          <p>Voice pathology detection refers to a detection procedure of the pathology in the vocal folds from an input voice. The detection can be subjective or objective. In subjective detection, an experienced physician hears the voice and assesses whether the voice is normal or pathological based on his or her previous knowledge and experience. However, this type of assessment may vary from physician to physician depending on the experience [1]. Therefore, an objective evaluation of voice pathology is gaining more attention day by day from both medical and engineering personnel.</p>

           
       <P>This paper describes a preliminary investigation of
        Voice Pathology Detection using Deep Neural Networks (DNN).
        We used voice recordings of sustained vowel /a/ produced at
        normal pitch from German corpus Saarbruecken Voice Database
        (SVD). This corpus contains voice recordings and electroglotograph signals of more than 2 000 speakers. The idea behind
        this experiment is the use of convolutional layers in combination
        with recurrent Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) layers on raw
        audio signal. Each recording was split into 64 ms Hamming
        windowed segments with 30 ms overlap. Our trained model
        achieved 71.36 % accuracy with 65.04% sensitivity and 77.67 %
        specificity on 206 validation files and 68.08 % accuracy with
        66.75 % sensitivity and 77.89 % specificity on 874 testing files.
        This is a promising result in favor of this approach because it is
        comparable to similar previously published experiment that used
        different methodology. Further investigation is needed to achieve
        the state-of-the-art results.
        </P>
        <p>The advancement of technology offers solution to the complex problems faced by the society and brings the wellbeing of the individuals. Smart healthcare is prominent nowadays for diagnosis, treatment and constant monitoring which reduces visitation of hospital, transport cost and waiting time. Voice pathology is a decease which affects the person vocal cord so that one who facing difficult in speech. If the decease not identified in time, it leads to permanent loss of voice for an individual. Traditionally, the decease is identified through oral examination or manual procedures. Due to the advent of smart phone, one can record the voice and send it to the cloud server for processing. Our system classifies the voice data and provides the decision to the user. This greatly reduces the transport cost, and waiting time for oral examination at medical center. The mobile phone recorded the patient voice data and it will be stored into the cloud. The voice data is synthesized to signals and with the help of deep Neural network the voice pathology can be identified. The system has been tested with the data set and the test result shows promising.</p>
